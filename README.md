# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a simple calculator where the user can enter in any number or operator either through clicking on the html element or entering the number through a keyboard. Once the user has decided on the mathematical operation they want to performed they can just hit the "Enter" key on your keyboard or click on the "=" element. Answers from a previous calculation will be saved on the calculator until the clear element is clicked. The user has a choice of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modular arithmetic.
